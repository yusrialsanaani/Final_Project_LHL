Project Title: 
Movie Recommendation

Goal: 
Predicting movies for people based on their interests.

Project description: 
- Developing Knowledge-based, Content-based, Collaborative Recommender system,
and  hybrid movie recommender system that combines user ratings and content of 
the movies  using MovieLens dataset with 25,000095 movie ratings. 
- These Recommender systems will be built using Pandas operations and by fitting some 
scikit-learn/surprise models which use NLP techniques to suggest movies for the users 
based on similar users and for queries specific to genre, user Similarity, movie 
Similarity, rating, popularity, or hybrid query. 
- Recommender System using Deep Neural Network maybe used if I have time.
